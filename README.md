# Beyond TWAP: Smarter Rule-Based Execution Algorithms

## Overview

This project explores two rule-based execution strategies designed to outperform the conventional Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) method by leveraging real-time market signals. The goal is to minimize spread costs and improve execution quality using systematic, data-driven trade decision logic.

## Objective

- Improve upon TWAP using microstructure-aware features.
- Reduce average execution spread across varying market regimes.
- Evaluate strategy robustness under both bullish and bearish scenarios.

## Dataset

- High-frequency limit order book data for 5 US stocks: AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, INTC
- Features include timestamp, prices, volumes, order IDs, direction, mid-price, and spread

## Feature Engineering

Key derived features:
- **Spread Ticks**: `(Ask - Bid) / Tick Size`
- **Order Flow Imbalance**: Rolling imbalance of bid/ask volume
- **Momentum**: Log return of mid-price over 50-point window
- **Microprice**: Volume-weighted mid-point between bid and ask
- **Price Velocity**: 5-period difference in mid-price

Synthetic bullish data was created to complement the primarily bearish dataset.

## Strategies

### 1. Event-Driven Dual Execution Strategy (Used for GOOG, INTC, MSFT)

- Adaptive, three-stage execution: Early, Mid, and Forced
- Conditions based on spread, volume imbalance, and price momentum
- Parameters tuned via grid search to balance aggressiveness and execution quality

### 2. Combined Microprice and Spread Tiers (Used for AAPL, AMZN)

- Executes based on microprice position and tiered spread thresholds
- Time-dependent thresholds (5s, 15s, 25s, 45s, 59s)
- Aims for early fills with fallback execution at minute end

## Optimization

- Grid search used for threshold tuning
- Objective: Minimize average execution spread
- Calibrated separately for each stock

## Performance Metrics

| Symbol | Strategy | TWAP Spread | Avg Spread | Improvement |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| AAPL   | Microprice-Tiers | 0.1421 | 0.0313 | 77.97% |
| AMZN   | Microprice-Tiers | 0.1031 | 0.0318 | 69.15% |
| GOOG   | Event-Driven     | 0.1992 | 0.0447 | 77.56% |
| INTC   | Event-Driven     | 0.0146 | 0.0033 | 76.71% |
| MSFT   | Event-Driven     | 0.0139 | 0.0023 | 83.45% |

## Key Takeaways

- **Spread** is the most influential feature across all strategies.
- **Microprice-Tier** strategy excels on liquid, stable stocks like AAPL and AMZN.
- **Event-Driven** strategy works better for volatile or event-sensitive stocks like GOOG.
- Rule-based methods offer practical, interpretable alternatives to complex learning models.
- Both strategies outperform TWAP significantly in diverse conditions.

## Conclusion

Simple rule-based execution strategies, when calibrated to the microstructure of individual assets, can provide substantial improvements over na√Øve benchmarks like TWAP. These strategies are not only effective but also interpretable and adaptable across asset classes and market conditions. Future enhancements could include integrating learning-based models or using reinforcement learning for real-time adaptive execution logic.
